## Supervised Learning
* A Statistical model trained on a predictor & responses. 
* Regression & Classification Algorithms falls under this category.

## Unsupervised Learning
* Clustering & Association Algorithms falls under this category.
* Analyze hidden patterns in data.

## Reinforcement Learning
* A Statistical model that learns to make decisions sequentially.
* In Laymen terms, the output of the model will depend on the present input, and the next input will depend on the previous output of the model.
